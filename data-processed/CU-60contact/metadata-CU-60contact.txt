model_contributors: Charles C. Branas, Andrew Rundle, Sen Pei, Wan Yang, Brendan G. Carr, Sarah Sims, Alexis Zebrowski, Ronan Doorley, Neil Schluger, James Quinn, Jeffrey Shaman

model_targets: daily new confirmed case, daily new infection (both reported and unreported), cumulative demand of hospital beds, ICU and ventilators as well as daily mortality. (Note that hospitalizations and ICU bed numbers indicate the current demand on a given day, NOT just the new persons needing beds.)

forecast_startdate: 2020-03-13 
forecast_frequency: 1-2x weekly

data_inputs_known: County-level case data; counts and availability of hospital beds that could be used for critical care
data_source_known: USAFACTS. https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/; 2020 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Health Care Information System (HCRIS) Data File, Sub-System Hospital Cost Report (CMS-2552-96 and CMS-2552-10), Section S-3, Part 1, Column 2; the 2018 American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey; the 2020 US DHHS Health Resources and Services Administration, Area Health Resources Files (AHRF); the 2017-2019 CMS Medicare Provider of Services file, Medicare Cost Report, Hospital Compare Files.

    Estimates of spatio-temporal COVID-19 demand and medical system critical 
    care supply were calculated for all continental US counties. These estimates were 
    statistically summarized and mapped for US counties, regions and urban versus non-urban areas. 
    Estimates of COVID-19 infections and patients needing critical care were calculated for 
    21-day and 42-day time periods starting from April 2, 2020 to May 13, 2020 for a reactive 
    pattern of 40% contact reduction ("60contact") through actions such as social distancing.
    Multiple national public and private datasets were linked and harmonized in order to calculate 
    county-level hospital critical care bed counts that include currently available beds and those 
    that could be made available under four surge response scenarios – very low, low, medium, and high – 
    as well as deaths in counties that had exceeded their hospital critical care capacity limits.
